# Contributing

✨ Thank you for contributing ✨

I want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn
```

> While it's possible to use [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli), the tooling is built around [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/), so you'll have an easier time if you use `yarn` for development.

While developing, you can run the [example app](/example/) to test your changes. Any changes you make in your library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild. If you change any native code, then you'll need to rebuild the example app.

To start the packager:

```sh
yarn example start
```

To run the example app on Android:

```sh
yarn example android
```

Make sure your code passes TypeScript. Run the following to verify:

```sh
yarn typescript
```

Remember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:

```sh
yarn test
```

To edit the Kotlin files, open `example/android` in Android studio and find the source files at `reactnativeandroidcurrencyformatter` under `Android`.

### Scripts

The `package.json` file contains various scripts for common tasks:

- `yarn bootstrap`: setup project by installing all dependencies and pods.
- `yarn typescript`: type-check files with TypeScript.
- `yarn test`: run unit tests with Jest.
- `yarn example start`: start the Metro server for the example app.
- `yarn example android`: run the example app on Android.

### Sending a pull request

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters and tests are passing.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
